I am a Software Engineer. I develop effective, high-quality, scalable software solutions. I love to learn new technologies and frameworks.
I have acquired decent technical skills with various programming languages, tools, software packages. With my analytical approach and reasoning, I am capable of breaking down any real-world problem into simple logical issues and address them one by one to build a robust solution for the real problem.
